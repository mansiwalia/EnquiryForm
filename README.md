# EnquiryForm

The **Student Inquiry Form** is designed to collect essential information about students and their families for effective record-keeping and communication. It includes fields for personal details such as the student's phone number, email address, and class. Additionally, it gathers information about the student's parents (father and mother), including their names and contact details, ensuring that communication channels are open with guardians. The form also includes a section for sibling information, allowing the institution to track family relationships for better service. This form serves as an efficient tool for organizing and managing student-related data.
